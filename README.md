<!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
## How it Works

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This App uses infinite Scrolling to prevent obtaining 1000+ pokemon at the same time, also it uses functional components and stateful components, also it uses hooks.

This is a SPA, (it uses only the homepage for everything), retrieves the information from the API and set on the internal state of the parent component (PokemonContainer), and if you search a single pokemon that information is saved on the NavbarComponent and it passes to a child component to show the pokemon card.

This application has the source code inside the src folder, the file structure for this project are:
* assets folder: Here are the assets like the logo and the CSS files (not a single line of CSS because everything is atomic CSS thanks to tailwindcss framework).
* components folder: Here are all of the stateless components Like errors, loading, or cards.
* containers folder: Here are all of the components that retrieve data from the API, and had state (stateful component like pokemonContainer or functional component with hooks like navbar).
* index.js file: Here is where is render the application in the div with id = "root".

Also, this project is fully responsive for all types of devices, mobile, tablet, desktop, wide-desktop, it uses tailwindCss for that.

## Running the code

*   Navigate to the root directory of the project

*   Run this command on your terminal to install all of the dependecies:
    ```
    $ npm install
    ```

*   Run this command on your terminal to run the code locally on http://localhost:3000:
    ```
    $ npm start
    ```

*   Also you can build this app for production, react are going to make a build folder with minified files, and filenames with hashes for best performance
    ```
    $ npm build
    ```
*   Run this command to Lint the JS files:
    ```
    $ npx eslint .
    ```
*   Run this command to Lint the CSS/SCSS files:
    ```
    $ npx stylelint "**/*.{css,scss}"
    ```
*   You can learn more in the [Create React App Documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
